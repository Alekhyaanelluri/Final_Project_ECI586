Predicting Bank Term Deposit Subscriptions Using Machine Learning in R


This project leverages statistical learning techniques in R to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on data from a American bank's telemarketing campaigns.

Project Overview
Term deposits are a significant source of income for banks. This project aims to optimize telemarketing campaigns by identifying customers most likely to subscribe to a term deposit, reducing costs and improving efficiency. The analysis includes data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, and predictive modeling using techniques like Random Forests.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing and understanding the data trends.
Predictive Modeling: Building and evaluating a Random Forest model to predict customer subscription.
Performance Metrics: Evaluating the model using metrics such as Cohen's kappa and accuracy.

Tools & Technologies
Programming Language: R
Libraries: Tidyverse, RandomForest, ggplot2
Data Source: Portuguese bank's marketing campaign data
How to Run
Clone the repository.
Open the Jupyter Notebook or R Markdown file.
Install the required R libraries mentioned in the notebook.
Run the cells sequentially to execute the analysis.

Results
The Random Forest model identified 84% of the subscribers in the test dataset, demonstrating high predictive accuracy. The insights can guide targeted telemarketing efforts.
